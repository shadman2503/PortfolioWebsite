# Portfolio Website

This is a **learning project** recreated while following the course  
**Modern HTML & CSS From the Beginning** by *Brad Traversy*.

This is a personal portfolio website built using the concept of **Sass** (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) to organize and manage CSS efficiently. The site showcases personal branding, UI/UX skills, and web development projects.
